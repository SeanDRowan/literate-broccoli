    <div class="about-me-info">
      <p> My name is Sean Rowan and I am learning to program HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Early in my teens, I realized how fascinated I was with the study of history. 


        Following this path, I pursued a degree in History and later graduated from Texas A&M San Antonio. 
        
        
        I have always been curious and like to know how things work so in addition to history, I routinely dip into other academic fields. 
        
        
        Originally I was drawn to teaching because I like the feeling of learning something new and a close second to that is teaching someone something new. Also, when teaching others, you really can’t help but learn things yourself.  I chose social studies because it encompasses many different interconnected disciplines. I started my first year at Roosevelt High School teaching Government, which is fun because it also includes History as well as a bit of philosophy.  During my first few years I also taught Economics.  One day my department head asked me if I knew anyone who wanted to teach AP Psychology and I immediately volunteered.  I deeply enjoy psychology as a field of study, and am frequently told the same by my students. I taught high school for 6 years. 
        While I have enjoyed it immensely, my desire to keep learning has led me to take a sabbatical from teaching.  I’m currently enrolled in a 36 week intensive full stack coding boot camp at UTSA.  
        
        
        It's a great program, which, I'm sure will lead to a host of exciting career opportunities.
